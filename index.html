<dd><strong>Infrastructure Engineer at DueDil</strong>
</dd>
<dd>In my final year of university, I wanted to put the skills I had learned in to practice, and was offered a job on the engineering team at DueDil. Although I was initially employed to cover the internal IT helpdesk (give out credentials, sort hardware issues, etc), my remit spread to include building internal tooling such as an LDAP/Github/server integration, and working on parts of the tooling around provisioning, managing, and tearing down infrastructure.
</dd>
<dt>2015</dt>
<dd>Cyber Intelligence Analyst at Digital Shadows
</dd>
<dd>I joined Digital Shadows on a three month internship whilst at university, and following this was offered a full time position. My primary role was to identify and investigate potential threats to clients, then provide actionable write up and assessment in the form of a written alert. This work consistently required accurate, time sensitive analysis of a range of potential threats, including data breaches, technical vulnerabilities and threat actor activity.
</dd>
<dt>2013-2015</dt>
<dd>Personal Assistant to HNWI (Self Employed)
</dd>
<dd>Whilst at university, I worked two days a week term time and full time during breaks, from the private residence of a HNWI. The couple had recently purchased a multi million pound house and were having it completely renovated. I was tasked with overseeing the project, including liaising with contractors, managing the project schedule, and anticipating potential blockers/risks and communicating these upwards. This role also involved diary management, organising travel, managing the housekeeper, research, and event management.
</dd>
<dt>2012-2013</dt>
<dd>Personal Assistant/Office Manager/Head of People at DueDil
</dd>
<dd>I joined DueDil as employee number 18, in the catch-all title of Office Manager. During this time I managed an office move, set up HR best practices and hired staff, liaised with VC firms and investors, attended hiring events including speaking on a panel at Silicon Milkroundabout, assisted with our customer helpdesk, and managed the diaries of both CEO and COO. I also organised and took part in the company hackathon in which I built the foundations for an employee intranet integrated with GitHub, Google Calendar and Google Mail.
</dd>
<dt>2012</dt>
<dd>Executive Assistant at Facebook
</dd>
<dd>I was employed at Facebook as PA to the MD of EMEA, Joanna Shields. My duties included extensive diary management, facilitating client meetings, researching and writing executive summaries, organising complicated travel, and expense preparation and reporting. I was also involved in organising company-wide hackathons and arranging office events. Whilst working at Facebook I started a part time Computer Science course in the evening, which I converted to full time in Aug 2013.

<dd>Board Member, Girls in Tech London
</dd>
<dd>I am a board member and currently work on the events team for Girls in Tech, organising and running both technical and non-technical events for women in London. Having been the first female hire at a 17 strong startup, I believe it is important for women to get the encouragement and skills they need to excel in their fields. We have recently launched a highly successful mentoring programme for women looking to take the next step in their careers.

<dd>Seekr
</dd>
<dd>Seekr was an app created during a 48 hour hackathon. Our team created a map based event discovery app, using server side clustering and matching to detect and classify events of any size based on a realtime feed of social media from various sources. The map was populated from data gathered from Twitter, Instagram, Flickr as well as a photo capture interface in the app. We created an iOS application powered by a NodeJS + Elasticsearch API hosted in EC2 which was populated by a Laravel PHP application that gathered social media from external sources.
