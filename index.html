<dt><strong>2016-2017</strong></dt>
<dd><strong>Junior Software Engineer at Ravelin</strong>
</dd>
<dd>Whilst at Ravelin I worked with one other engineer on the Integrations Team, providing font-line support to clients to help them integrate our API into their codebase. I also contributed to our core repo which required me to learn Go, and an internal hackathon for which I learnt Angular2.

<dd>Infrastructure Engineer at DueDil
</dd>
<dd>In my final year of university, I wanted to put the skills I had learned in to practice, and was offered a job on the engineering team at DueDil. Although I was initially employed to cover the internal IT helpdesk (give out credentials, sort hardware issues, etc), my remit spread to include building internal tooling such as an LDAP/Github/server integration, and working on parts of the tooling around provisioning, managing, and tearing down infrastructure.

<dd>Cyber Intelligence Analyst at Digital Shadows

<dd>I joined Digital Shadows on a three month internship whilst at university, and following this was offered a full time position. My primary role was to identify and investigate potential threats to clients, then provide actionable write up and assessment in the form of a written alert. This work consistently required accurate, time sensitive analysis of a range of potential threats, including data breaches, technical vulnerabilities and threat actor activity.

<dd>Personal Assistant to HNWI (Self Employed)
</dd>
<dd>Whilst at university, I worked two days a week term time and full time during breaks, from the private residence of a HNWI. The couple had recently purchased a multi million pound house and were having it completely renovated. I was tasked with overseeing the project, including liaising with contractors, managing the project schedule, and anticipating potential blockers/risks and communicating these upwards. This role also involved diary management, organising travel, managing the housekeeper, research, and event management.
</dd>

<dd>Personal Assistant/Office Manager/Head of People at DueDil

During this time I managed an office move, set up HR best practices and hired staff, liaised with VC firms and investors, attended hiring events including speaking on a panel at Silicon Milkroundabout, assisted with our customer helpdesk, and managed the diaries of both CEO and COO. I also organised and took part in the company hackathon in which I built the foundations for an employee intranet integrated with GitHub, Google Calendar and Google Mail.
</dd>
<dt>2012</dt>
<dd>Executive Assistant at Facebook
</dd>
<dd>I was employed at Facebook as PA to the MD of EMEA, Joanna Shields.

Whilst working at Facebook I started a part time Computer Science course in the evening, which I converted to full time in Aug 2013.

<dd>Board Member, Girls in Tech London
</dd>
<dd>I am a board member and currently work on the events team for Girls in Tech, organising and running both technical and non-technical events for women in London. Having been the first female hire at a 17 strong startup, I believe it is important for women to get the encouragement and skills they need to excel in their fields. We have recently launched a highly successful mentoring programme for women looking to take the next step in their careers.

<dd>Seekr
</dd>
<dd>Seekr was an app created during a 48 hour hackathon. Our team created a map based event discovery app, using server side clustering and matching to detect and classify events of any size based on a realtime feed of social media from various sources. The map was populated from data gathered from Twitter, Instagram, Flickr as well as a photo capture interface in the app. We created an iOS application powered by a NodeJS + Elasticsearch API hosted in EC2 which was populated by a Laravel PHP application that gathered social media from external sources.
