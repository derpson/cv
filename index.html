<dd>Seekr was an app created during a 48 hour hackathon. Our team created a map based event discovery app, using server side clustering and matching to detect and classify events of any size based on a realtime feed of social media from various sources. The map was populated from data gathered from Twitter, Instagram, Flickr as well as a photo capture interface in the app. We created an iOS application powered by a NodeJS + Elasticsearch API hosted in EC2 which was populated by a Laravel PHP application that gathered social media from external sources.
