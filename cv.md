Professional Experience
=======================

**2015–2016**
:   **Infrastructure Engineer at DueDil**
:   In my final year of university, I wanted to put the skills I had learned in
    to practice, and was offered a job on the engineering team at DueDil.
    Although I was initially employed to cover the internal IT helpdesk (give
    out credentials, sort hardware issues, etc), my remit spread to include
    building internal tooling such as an LDAP/Github/server integration, and
    working on parts of the tooling around provisioning, managing, and tearing
    down infrastructure.

2015
:   Cyber Intelligence Analyst at Digital Shadows
:   I joined Digital Shadows on a three month internship whilst at university,
    and following this was offered a full time position. My primary role was to
    identify and investigate potential threats to clients, then provide
    actionable write up and assessment in the form of a written alert. This work
    consistently required accurate, time sensitive analysis of a range of
    potential threats, including data breaches, technical vulnerabilities and
    threat actor activity.

2013-2015
:   Personal Assistant to HNWI (Self Employed)
:   Whilst at university, I worked two days a week term time and full time
    during breaks, from the private residence of a HNWI. The couple had recently
    purchased a multi million pound house and were having it completely
    renovated. I was tasked with overseeing the project, including liaising with
    contractors, managing the project schedule, and anticipating potential
    blockers/risks and communicating these upwards. This role also involved
    diary management, organising travel, managing the housekeeper, research, and
    event management.

2012-2013
:   Personal Assistant/Office Manager/Head of People at DueDil
:   I joined DueDil as employee number 18, in the catch-all title of Office
    Manager. During this time I managed an office move, set up HR best practices
    and hired staff, liaised with VC firms and investors, attended hiring events
    including speaking on a panel at Silicon Milkroundabout, assisted with our
    customer helpdesk, and managed the diaries of both CEO and COO. I also
    organised and took part in the company hackathon in which I built the
    foundations for an employee intranet integrated with GitHub, Google Calendar
    and Google Mail.

2012
:   Executive Assistant at Facebook
:   I was employed at Facebook as PA to the MD of EMEA, Joanna Shields. My
    duties included extensive diary management, facilitating client meetings,
    researching and writing executive summaries, organising complicated travel,
    and expense preparation and reporting. I was also involved in organising
    company-wide hackathons and arranging office events. Whilst working at
    Facebook I started a part time Computer Science course in the evening, which
    I converted to full time in Aug 2013.

Personal Projects
=================

2013-today
:   Board Member, Girls in Tech London
:   I am a board member and currently work on the events team for Girls in Tech,
    organising and running both technical and non-technical events for women in
    London. Having been the first female hire at a 17 strong startup, I believe
    it is important for women to get the encouragement and skills they need to
    excel in their fields. We have recently launched a highly successful
    mentoring programme for women looking to take the next step in their
    careers.

2013
:   Seekr
:   Seekr was an app created during a 48 hour hackathon. Our team created a map
    based event discovery app, using server side clustering and matching to
    detect and classify events of any size based on a realtime feed of social
    media from various sources. The map was populated from data gathered from
    Twitter, Instagram, Flickr as well as a photo capture interface in the app.
    We created an iOS application powered by a NodeJS + Elasticsearch API hosted
    in EC2 which was populated by a Laravel PHP application that gathered social
    media from external sources.
